                      If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy,
                      don&apos;t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty
                      of lives and whole towns destroyed or about
                      to be. We are not wise, and not very often
                      kind. And much can never be redeemed.
                      
                      Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this
                      is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
                      something happens better than all the riches
                      or power in the world. It could be anything,
                      but very likely you notice it in the instant
                      when love begins. Anyway, that&apos;s often the
                      case. Anyway, whatever it is, don&apos;t be afraid
                      of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb.
