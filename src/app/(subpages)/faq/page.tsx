                No, while we love your little ones, both wedding celebrations will be adults-only except for our immediate nieces and nephews. We hope that you will understand this decision and that you will still be able to join us to celebrate.

                  <strong>Saturday:</strong> For the wedding at the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the dress code is formal and vibrant. We&apos;ll check the weather leading up to the day to adjust if needed, but note that we&apos;re hoping the ceremony can be outside (unless it rains).

                    If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy,
                    don&apos;t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty
                    of lives and whole towns destroyed or about
                    to be. We are not wise, and not very often
                    kind. And much can never be redeemed.
                    
                    Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this
                    is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
                    something happens better than all the riches
                    or power in the world. It could be anything,
                    but very likely you notice it in the instant
                    when love begins. Anyway, that&apos;s often the
                    case. Anyway, whatever it is, don&apos;t be afraid
                    of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb.
